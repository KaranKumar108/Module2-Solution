            The history of mobile phones covers mobile communication devices
            that connect wirelessly to the public switched telephone network.
            While the transmission of speech by signal has a long history, the
            first devices that were wireless, mobile, and also capable of
            connecting to the standard telephone network are much more recent.
            The first such devices were barely portable compared to today's
            compact hand-held devices,

            The history of tablet computers and the associated special operating
            software is an example of pen computing technology, and thus the
            development of tablets has deep historical roots. The first patent
            for a system that recognized handwritten characters by analyzing the
            handwriting motion was granted in 1914. The first publicly
            demonstrated system using a tablet and handwriting recognition
            instead of a keyboard for working with

            Computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences
            of arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically.
            Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of
            operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to
            perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a nominally
            complete computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main
            software), and peripheral.
